   * Returns a request handler for adding header and footer frontend components to res.locals

   * Adds stringified html for each component along with lists of css javascript links.
   *
   * Expects nunjucks and res.locals.user to be set up inline with the hmpps-template-typescript project
   *
   * @param requestOptions - config object for request
   * @param requestOptions.dpsUrl - url to the dps homepage to be used in the header
   * @param requestOptions.authUrl - if your service has users with non-nomis auth sources, pass in the url to the auth service for the home link
   * @param requestOptions.supportUrl - if your service has users with non-nomis auth sources, pass in the support url for the support link
   * @param requestOptions.environmentName - if you require environment tags on the fallback banner "DEV", "PRE-PRODUCTION" or "PRODUCTION" can be passed in
   * @param requestOptions.logger - pass in the bunyen logger if you want to use it. Falls back to console if not provided
   * @param requestOptions.timeoutOptions - timeout object for superagent. Defaults to 2500ms
   * @param requestOptions.includeSharedData - adds sharedData to res.locals.feComponents if true. Contains data that the components have collected in order to render, including: activeCaseLoad, caseLoads and available services for user
   * @param requestOptions.useFallbacksByDefault - if your service requires only the basic fallback header and footer to be used by default, set this to true, it will not attempt to fetch the components from the frontend components service
